<p><font size="2.5">Insights taken into account and revisions made - iterative learning at its finest.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Today, I had to sit down and think of all the
things that had gone wrong with the last few Scratchlets workshops. I
needed to devise new techniques to teach my class, but how? I started
thinking of a scenario in my head and chalking it out on a chalk board.
I hate the sound of chalk on a chalk board, it drives me
crazy….errgghh.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Scenario: A boy named Salman is sleeping in his bed
(starting position). He wakes up and walks over to a table in his room
(turn +45 degrees and move 3 steps). He puts on his hat (change
costume). He decides to visit his girlfriend Parvati and walks out of
his home (turn +45 degrees and move 5 steps). The path to Parvati’s
house is windey and twisty. He must walk forward a few paces and make a
sharp turn (move 4 steps and turn -90 degrees). He is so excited to see
Parvati, that he randomly starts doing a dance (Repeat - move 2 steps,
turn +180), and then turns and continues down the path (turn +45
degrees, move 7 steps). When he finally arrives at Parvati’s house, she
is sleeping so he rings the doorbell (play sound). Now here come the
conditional statements. When Parvati wakes up and opens the door “if”
she shakes Salman’s hand, he says “hello,” “else” he waits/knocks
harder (play sound)/turns in a circle.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I used the scenario mentioned above, to demonstrate
the use and purpose of Scratchlets. My thinking in doing this was that
children learn best when they’re having fun. Rather than simply
explaining the functions, I thought a story would help convey the
various pieces on the board. It worked! The children immediately caught
on, and you could already see the excitement in their eyes. Instead of
my bicycle example, I asked the children how they would prepare the
traditional south Indian dish of Sambar (Indian soup) and rice. They
talked about all the logical steps one would have to follow, including
washing the rice and adding water. I then asked them, what if you put
too much salt in the Sambar. They responded, “we would think about what
we did wrong, and if there was too much salt, we would either add more
water to the Sambar or more salt to the rice, so both dishes would be
equally salty.” Maybe not how I think about cooking, but it was still
very clever.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">During the demonstration process, my friend Paddy
was translating for me (he was awesome!). The rest of the teachers were
either on their cell phones or chit chatting. When it came time to
execute, the children seem to have a better grasp of the game than the
teachers. The same teachers who had helped me previously were asking me
questions which were explained during the demonstration. It was
becoming increasingly difficult to get their full commitment. One
teacher however, recognized my frustration and really stepped up to the
plate. Another teacher unfortunately, was really overwhelming the
children. It was to the point that the children were freezing up
instead of moving forward. After pulling her away, I noticed the
children started communicating with one another and started problem
solving their way through the path. That’s when I realized that the
teachers were making the students feel tense, and when the students
were just left to be that’s when they really started to flourish.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">The most important lesson I learned today was that
it didn’t really matter if the children were programming each and every
station correctly; it was the process and journey of learning that was
important. When some of the children were left on their own to try and
get through the circuit, they often missed the dance station, and
completely forgot about the “if” statement. I had to remind myself, it
was okay. They still knew and understood the other pieces and that was
a huge step in the right direction.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Rather than only measuring children on the
correctness of their output, teachers and mentors should also account
for participation and effort. Without those, children are no longer
children they are robots; a dangerous trap that adults tend to fall
pray too.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">A funny observation…</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">There was one group made up of 2 boys and 1 girl.
The boys were having all the fun programming away, while the girl was
the robot doing as she was being told. Now that’s sexism at its
finest…some things never change!</font></p>

<p><font size="2.5">What is Integrated Learning Curriculum? No idea,
but at the time, it sounded like a good title for the brainstorming
exercise I conducted with some Agastya teachers. Today we were
brainstorming ways to teach a common theme across multiple subject
areas using tools that cater to each of the following learning styles:
auditory, visual, tactile, and experiential.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Just imagine a curriculum whereby students could
take a walk through an herbal garden with an ecology instructor to
learn about plants and flowers (auditory learning). They could then
conduct experiments on how those plants work in the human body
(experiential/biology), and finally examine the shape, structure and
color of the plants and create sculptures which mimic their function or
behavior (visual/art).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I was challenged today to come up with compelling
ways to engage the teachers, build a sense of team unity, and ensure an
overall fun experience. I started doing some internal brainstorming
when a recent memory entered my head. The first time I met Mr. Raghavan
of Agastya was at MIT. After our meeting, we headed to IDEO, one of
world’s most recognized industrial design firms. It was at IDEO where
Mr. Raghavan tasked myself and 1O IDEO employees to develop ways to
teach children concepts of biology and time change. We broke out into 3
small groups, discussed wacky and over the top ideas, drew on sticky
notes and posted them up on white boards. I decided to utilize a
similar approach to brainstorm with the Agastya teachers.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Today, I had a group of 20 teachers from various
subject areas. I began the workshop by playing an ice breaker game
called the Human Web. The teachers sat in a semi-circle around me. One
teacher would state an interesting fact about him/her self, hold one
part of the string and throw the roll to a colleague across the circle.
This process continued for about 10 minutes until a giant web had
formed between all the teachers, connecting them in a symbolic way, by
their individualism and diversity.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I explained to the teachers what they’d be
brainstorming about that day and why brainstorming was an important
part of learning. I also presented two posters, one displaying some of
the rules of the workshop e.g., lots of discussion, writing/drawing
down ideas, and no criticizing, the other listing different types of
learning styles.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I divided the teachers up into 3 groups and gave
them each pens, sticky notes and a white board. I first asked the
teachers to brainstorm possible themes that could be taught across
multiple subject areas. I asked them to NOT over think their ideas or
how they could be applied or taught. Some of the groups came up with up
to 30 ideas, which they narrowed down to three. They then presented
their ideas to the other groups, and each group identified one theme
they wanted to work on. The three themes chosen were: cosmetics,
cricket (sport), and the nature/behavior of animals.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Finally, the teachers were tasked to think of three
subject areas that were applicable and how they could teach concepts of
those subjects using their theme as an example. They had to keep the
various different learning styles in mind while designing their tools.
Here are some highlights from the brainstorming workshop:</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5"><strong>Cricket</strong></font></p>
<ul>
<font size="2.5"><li>Biology
<ul>
<li>Experiential learning - Conduct an experiment about how much
players sweat during a cricket game based upon the color of their
uniform. &nbsp;Players wear darker color during one day matches and
lighter colors during multiple day matches.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physics
<ul>
<li>Visual and Auditory – hit a cricket ball with a cricket bat and
observe the sound. The teacher can then provide an explanation about
sound waves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chemistry
<ul>
<li>Tactile- Announcers for cricket games need microphones to conduct
their commentary, and those microphones require batteries. Children can
thus hold, touch and feel different types of batteries and learn about
their properties.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</font></ul>
<p><font size="2.5"><strong>Cosmetics</strong></font></p>
<ul>
<font size="2.5"><li>Chemistry
<ul>
<li>Experiential and Tactile – Children can experiment with different
raw materials commonly found in cosmetics. They can then compare and
contrast the use of natural vs. chemical inputs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Art
<ul>
<li>Visual and Tactile- Can combine different colors to create different shades of lipstick and eye shadows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Math
<ul>
<li>Auditory – The teacher can explain concepts of ratios and ingredient amounts as they relate to cosmetics.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</font></ul>
<p><font size="2.5"><strong>Nature/Behavior of Animals</strong></font></p>
<ul>
<font size="2.5"><li>Biology
<ul>
<li>Auditory- The teacher can discuss theories of evolution.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physics
<ul>
<li>Visual- Children can watch shows such as the Discovery Channel to learn about bird flight.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Art
<ul>
<li>Visual and Tactile- Children and teachers can observe animals at
the zoo and collect different materials in the environment to recreate
the animals e.g., use tree bark, bottle caps and rocks, to construct a
lion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</font></ul>
<p><font size="2.5">Each group presented their ideas to the class. All
other teachers were encouraged to ask questions and build upon ideas.
Many ideas were discussed and lesson plans were revised. At the end of
the workshop, I had asked one teacher from each group to provide me
with a write up of their lesson plan to be shared and distributed among
other members of Agastya.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Although this was a fun lesson in brainstorming,
what I hope the teachers got out of the entire process was an
understanding about communication; when they communicate and discuss
their visions, their ideas, their goals, new solutions to problems
emerge which are full of rich and diverse perspectives. The goal of the
workshop today was to encourage the teachers to think of new ways of
teaching and work together to enhance the experience of children coming
to Agastya. I think that’s what they got out of it, but you never know.
Hoping is also part of the learning process, I suppose?</font></p>

<p><font size="2.5"><em><strong>Scratchlets Workshop #2 at Agastya<br>Tuesday, January 19, 2010<br>Sanjli Gidwaney</strong></em></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2.5"><em>Failure: &nbsp;Noun, the condition or fact of not achieving the desired end or ends e.g., the failure of an experiment</em></font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">That’s about how I’m feeling right now. Like an
English paper with a big fat F stamped on it, in a thick red marker. Do
you ever wonder why teachers use the shade Flaring Red to mark papers
anyway? I mean, is that not the definition of “rubbing it in”? Okay, so
maybe the workshop today wasn’t &nbsp;a &nbsp;complete failure, but
every time I do a Scratchlets workshop, it becomes harder to recognize
if it’s me that just doesn’t get it, or is it the teachers, students,
or simply the software programming gods working against me.…what is
it?! If only I knew….the art of problem finding is as important as
problem solving (lesson learned, now can we please move on?).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Today I conducted my second Scratchlets workshop.
The children were of the 9th standard this time, an almost equal mix of
boys and girls. Earlier this afternoon, I did a re-training of the
teachers which seemed to help a little in some areas, not so much in
others. I started with the normal goals, explanation of the board, the
functions, some examples... My friend Paddy translated beautifully, he
even made the children laugh. A nice change from their rather serious
and military like demeanor e.g., saluting to greet you, standing when
you call their name.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Frustrating! Again the children were divided into
smaller groups, to work with one of the many teachers who were helping
out that day. I immediately noticed the teachers, instead of helping
the students think on their own, would complete the task for them. In
defense of the teachers, they wanted so badly for the children to
succeed, they would start taking over the learning process. However,
failure is a critical part of learning, the entire point of my workshop
rests on the shoulders of this very principle.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">The children would often stare blankly as I tested
their understanding of the lesson, signaling something was going wrong
somewhere. After a few times around the track, they started catching
onto the basic idea, but I still wasn’t sure how much was actually
resonating with them. I had made some provisions to the workshop today,
including the addition of a reference circle diagram to each board
detailing concepts such as clockwise, anticlockwise and degrees. I was
hoping this new addition would at least somewhat solve the challenge of
angled turning. Wrong! The children hardly looked at the diagram,
instead requesting multiple explanations on degrees and direction. It
was as if they wanted to be told what to do, instead of trying to
figure it out on their own. Eventually they started recognizing the
value in the diagram and would use it minimally when prompted. Perhaps,
the diagram wasn’t the best learning tool – a lesson for next time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">The debugging process was probably the most
interesting. The children were able to see their faults when testing
their programs, however, some of those faults were caused by poor
instruction on part of the teachers. This was a good way for the
teachers to learn problem solving as well.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">When we got to the reflection portion of the
workshop, I asked the children what they liked, didn’t like, what they
learned, and how it would be useful to them. They seemed to have
enjoyed programming their friends, making them dance, and turning them
into cartoon like characters, controlling their each and every move.
One child said that logical thinking was useful in improving thinking
in general – I really liked this kid. One child said the lessons
learned in this game could be used to start a business or learning how
to be good at your job – BINGO!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I later went outside to regroup with some of the
teachers. Paddy expressed some necessary adjustments (listed below)
which he felt would enhance the experience of the workshop. I have
really taken his advice to heart and plan on incorporating some of his
suggestions and my own insights into the next workshop.&nbsp;</font></p>
<ol>
<font size="2.5"><li>Don’t use the example of riding a bicycle or
programming a website, instead, use &nbsp;examples that are
contextually relevant and humorous e.g., how to make daal, how to eat
food</li>
<li>Take the entire class through a demonstration of programming a circuit</li>
<li>Encourage the teachers to allow the children to fail quickly and debug on their own</li>
<li>Structure the reflection discussion around problem solving&nbsp;</li>
<li>Make the end challenge station more climactic and exciting</li>
<li>Only one teacher should be translating during the introduction/reflection discussion</li>
<li>During reflection only ask one child one question – when children
know they will be asked multiple questions, they tend to shy away from
participating in the group discussion
<p></p></li>

	<p><em><strong>Microsoft Research and Infosys</strong></em><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>Monday, January 18, 2010<br>Sanjli Gidwaney</span></p>
<p>Hmmm, where do I begin…how about yesterday, where I spent an awesome
day at Microsoft Research and the famous Infosys campus in
Bangalore?&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Microsoft, I met Ed Cutrell, the head of Technologies for
Emerging Markets. His team is exploring innovative technologies in
areas such as education and agriculture for developing communities. One
such example is MultiPoint, a system which allows several children to
simultaneously use one computer with more than one mouse. In addition,
Ed’s team is finding opportunities to deliver educational content and
interactive games using specially designed DVDs which play on a common
household DVD player; a device which often can be found in both rural
and urban environments regardless of income level. Through an in-depth
ethnographic study conducted by Ed’s team, it was found that most
households already have the computing power in their DVD player and TV
to deliver many of the same experiences offered by more expensive
alternatives, including computers and laptops. For more information,
click here: <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/tem/default.aspx" target="_new">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/tem/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>My favorite moment of yesterday was riding a bicycle, around what is
probably the coolest office grounds I’ve ever seen. I mean, how would
you like it if your office was set in a serene oasis surrounded by lush
gardens, coy ponds, stunning fountains, open air canteens, tennis
courts, swimming pools, and fresh juice stalls etc. With bicycles
strategically placed around the campus, employees can freely and easily
move around from one building to another, of which there are more than
50.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Blog_files/infosys.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>While on our way out, we ventured into the conference center where
we read a notice for a talk being given by Dr. Charles Vest, former
president of MIT. The talk had drawn in heads of NGOs, thought leaders,
notable scholars and influential business owners. We decided to stay
for Mr. Vest’s lecture, where he discussed the importance and role of
creativity and multi disciplinary approaches to education, especially
in the realm of engineering. He also spoke about the ideal MIT student;
someone who doesn’t necessarily have the highest academic standing,
rather is willing to dive off cliffs, takes risks, and achieve new
heights. It was at that moment, that I took out my pad of paper, and
quickly drew a stick figure jumping off a mountain top. I passed my
doodle drawing to my husband, Vinay, and whispered, “that’s me!”</p>
<p>We arrived back at our hotel around 11pm, tired and exhausted. It’s
surprising how quickly the novelty of shuttling around in rickety
rickshaws, smelling of mixed masala and body odor, wears off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We slept for a few hours and got up at around 4am. When we ventured
downstairs to the hotel lobby, we were greeted by our very incompetent
concierge, an interaction I could’ve done without. He had hired us a
rip off cab to drive 5 minutes to the nearest train station, a scam
we’ve become accustomed to over our last few visits to India; the
concierge works out a deal with the cab driver which involves ripping
off passengers and sharing the profits. After much arguing we
negotiated the rate down to half, and jetted off to the train
station.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we finally boarded the train back we noticed there were no
seats available. We ended up standing for the 1.5 hour journey, being
bumped by chai, dosa, Lays Chips, Biscuit and coffee wallas. Everytime
they passed, about every 5 minutes, they would say “side, side” which
meant move out of the way. At one point I was so annoyed I said, “I’ll
show you side, how about OUTSIDE?!”As if that wasn’t bad enough, the
chai walla was serving an old man who was wearing a traditional white
lungi (a cloth skirt worn primarily by village men), when it came time
to pay, the old man pulled up his lungi to his waist, reached into his
boxer shorts, pulled out his wallet and handed the chai walla a 10
Rupee note. Yuck! The chai walla didn’t seem so bad anymore!</p>

<p><font size="2.5">Today I worked with a group of all girls, sweet, wonderful, and innocent 7<sup>th</sup>
graders excited to learn but timid in nature. They walked into the
classroom in an orderly fashion, and quickly sat down to observe the
lesson. I made several tweaks to the workshop, which I was looking
forward to testing. I smiled at my guinea pigs for the day, “good
afternoon everyone” I said, “good afternoon madam, they responded.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I started with the regular spiel about the goal of
the workshop, and what they’d be learning and doing. The girls worked
quietly without any conversation – it was hard to break their
concentration and encourage them to chat and have fun along the way.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">A few minutes later, in walked Ramji, the head of
the organization. Everyone stood at attendance, slightly fearful,
slightly in awe of his commanding, direct yet endearing nature. It is
without question that Ramji’s dedication to Agastya, is at the heart of
the organization’s ability to reach millions of children across South
India. While I explained my workshop to Ramji, he seemed pleased with
the fact that not only were the students learning new concepts and
principles, the teachers were as well. We broke for lunch where I
continued the conversation with Ramji about possible brainstorming
workshops with teachers, the young instructors program, and how to take
my workshops forward.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I returned to my class at 2:30pm and encouraged the
girls to quickly finish up their designs. A handful of boys also
requested to join my class. Then the fun really began. The teachers
performed a role playing exercise, whereby a small path was laid on the
ground in the form of the letter<em style=""> U</em>. On one end stood
Rama (positive figure in Hindu mythology) with Hanuman (monkey god) and
friends (monkeys), on the other, stood Sita, and finally in the center
stood Ravana (vileness figure in Hindu mythology). The story went
something like this; Rama had requested his friend Hanuman and fellow
monkeys to save his love Sita, from the evil Ravana. He instructed
Hanuman and fellow monkeys to follow the specific <em style="">U </em>shaped
path and wage a war against Ravana. Once the war was won, Hanuman was
to send a signal to Rama by lighting a flame. Hanuman would then
proceed to save Sita.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Putting this role play in context of a circuit:</font></p>
<ul>
<font size="2.5"><li>Rama- represented the positive charge</li>
<li>Sita- represented the negative charge</li>
<li>Hanuman’s monkey’s - &nbsp;represented the electrons</li>
<li>Hanuman’s triumph over Ravana – represented &nbsp;the LED lights</li>
<li>The path – represented the flow of electrons from the positive to negative charge&nbsp;</li>
</font></ul>
<p><font size="2.5">It was a fun dramatization of electric circuitry, one that seemed to resonate well with the students.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I showed the children how to sew electric circuits,
and tested their understanding of circuitry along the way. They would
often relate back to the story as a reference. When all the lights
started shining brightly, I noticed one girl struggling with her
circuit. She immediately realized that she had not sewn her thread
through one of the holes of the LED lights. She tried a few different
tactics before starting again and problem solving her way until she saw
the light go off. I watched closely as she employed her own ingenuity
and creative abilities to understand what she had done wrong and make
the necessary corrections. Failure is often the best teacher of life.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">The children later presented their E-Textiles to
the class and this time I encouraged all the spectators to question the
designs and their peers understanding of circuitry and electrons. At
times, the conversation went off track, too focused on the symbolism of
the design. One child even wrote my name on her shirt and explained to
the class that “Sanjli teaches E-Textile, and this lesson is like a
light, we should all become like lights and teach others.” That really
struck a chord in my heart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When another
child asked “why did you use green instead of blue” or “why did you
draw a star on one side and a sun on the other, when they cannot be
seen together, the child responded “well<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it’s my shirt and that’s how I like it.”</font></p>

	</font><p><font size="2.5"><em><strong>Scratchlets Workshop #1 at Agastya</strong></em><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>Tuesday, January 12, 2010<br>Sanjli Gidwaney</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I’m seriously and utterly pooped. Slightly
frustrated, and slightly relieved. Not sure which one I feel more. I’m
sitting on a swing, which ironically is a science model constructed to
demonstrate the transference of energy from one object to another. To
relieve some tension, I’m singing to myself as I watch a rainbow over
the horizon and some Agastya teachers play a game of volleyball.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Today I conducted my first <a href="http://www.kandoproject.org/request.php?q=node/18" target="_new">Scratchlets workshop</a>.
It didn’t quite go as planned, but I’m forcing myself to look at it as
a lesson on what not to do next time. I started the day by conducting a
teacher training workshop, explaining the principles and concepts
behind Scratchlets. I showed them the Scratch software and explained my
involvement with the Lifelong Kindergarten research group at MIT. They
seemed to understand, but I couldn’t be sure as in India, when you ask
someone “do you understand what I’m saying?” you often receive a
typical side to side head nod, which neither means yes or no. I decided
to take my chances, which in retrospect was not the smartest choice.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I was given a huge open space for my workshop,
where I laid down 3 physical tracks with 4 challenge stations. I had a
group of 15 children from the 7th standard who I split up into 3
groups. The objective of the workshop was to teach logical thinking and
problem solving using magnetic puzzle pieces, mimicking the interface
of the Scratch software.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I gave an introduction of myself translated into
Telugu by one of the teachers. The children seemed to understand the
general concepts, and displayed a great deal of enthusiasm and
willingness to learn. However, given the language barrier and some
challenges with the teachers, not all the concepts and principles were
being fully communicated and understood. There were also some
difficulties with advance circle geometry such as angles and concepts
of “if and else statements.” I also felt a little challenged by some of
the teachers coming up with their own instructions e.g., changing up
the stations or teaching workshop principles in sometimes incorrect
ways. With that being said, other teachers excelled in developing new
ways of testing the children’s understanding and encouraging them to
problem solve through the task at hand.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">We reconvened in a big circle where I reiterated
the concepts of logical thinking, the importance of problem solving and
the need to engage in reflection. When the children were asked if they
enjoyed or did not enjoy the workshop, one girl said she did NOT like
it. I was a little surprised, but still very much appreciative of her
honesty, as I too wanted to find ways of improving the experience for
the children. She explained that she did not understand why the
workshop was important and that if she was learning principles of
programming, why wasn’t she being taught on a computer. Before I could
respond to her in my MIT fashion with technology jargon, her classmate
Meena, who I would grow to love and admire, responded, “computers are
expensive and we cannot all afford to have them.&nbsp; By playing this
game we learned about computer programming and that is an important
lesson. We need to learn step by step about how computers work, before
we can start using them.” Needles to say, I was floored by her young
wisdom and simplicity, as she truly understood the value of the
workshop. .</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">At the end of the workshop, the children broke out
into traditional songs and were excited to share with me some of their
personal talents. Including a boy named Shiv Kumar, the master of beat
boxing and mimicry.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">As I sit on the swing and sing and reflect on the
fact that although the workshop had not gone as planned, and maybe all
the children did not fully grasp what I was trying to teach, I am
thankful for their honest attempt and perseverance. I have much to
revise in this workshop and am “problem solving” myself along the way.
We never really stop problem solving in life do we?</font></p>

	</font><p><font size="2.5"><em><strong>E-Textiles Workshop #1 at Agastya</strong></em><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>Monday, January 11, 2010<br>Sanjli Gidwaney</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2.5">What a relief?! I just completed
my very first E-Textiles workshop. This morning, a large group of
children from a school in North Karnataka arrived at the Agastya campus
excited and ready to learn.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2.5">I started the day by training
five male instructors how to conduct an E-Textiles workshop. The
teachers all nodded in understanding throughout the training process;
however, it wasn’t until I led them through a hands on demonstration
that they really started having fun with the various art supplies and
materials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was extremely important to me
that the teachers both understood and enjoyed the learning process as
they would partially be leading the workshop with my assistance.
Finally, at the end of the training, the teachers had designed a
fabulous mini E-Textiles t-shirt. When asked to explain the design they
proudly said “The<em style=""> U</em> shape means <em style="">you</em>. The<em style=""> A</em> is the logo of <em style="">Agastya</em>. The<em style=""> E</em> means <em style="">electronics</em>. The star represents a spark. Therefore, when you create an Agastya electronic you become a star.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><font size="2.5">We broke for lunch and
reconvened at 2pm, at which time I met with 10 male students, who would
be my students that day. I placed art supplies and the mini E-Textiles
t-shirts to be decorated in the center of four tables. I started the
workshop with a simple explanation of what they would be creating over
the course of the next 2 hours. I paused every so often to allow one of
the teachers to translate my dialogue into Telugu, the local language.
Each child decorated his t-shirt with intense concentration. It was
challenging to loosen them up, so I went around the classroom and
started cracking a few jokes encouraging them to talk amongst each
other and have fun. We then engaged in a religious role playing
exercise as a metaphor to explain the concept of electrons,
positive/negative charges, and LED lights. The children seemed to
really enjoy the active participation, especially since I had crafted
some simple costumes for them to wear.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><font size="2.5">Once complete, I showed
them the same concept via diagrams on a chalk board, relating each
image back to the role play exercise they had just witnessed. I then
used the E-Textiles T-Shirt the teachers created earlier that day, as
an example of how the diagram and role play related to the to the
battery and LED lights on their mini t-shirt they had just decorated. I
tasked the children to use conductive thread and a needle to complete
one full circuit. Mission accomplished, one by one, the tiny LED lights
on each child’s shirt began to light up. So did the smiles on their
faces. I was happy with the success rates, minus a few glitches which
were a blessing in disguise as they allowed the children the
opportunity to debug and problem solve, one of the primary goals of the
workshop.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><font size="2.5">I then asked, what do
you think would happen if I snipped a piece of your thread, what would
happen to your circuit? One child raised his hand high and responded,
“the flow of electricity will stop, the electrons will not be able to
reach the light and so the light will not work.” This explanation and
demonstration of understanding was critical to the workshop. Just as
important was the reflection and explanation of the design of the
shirt. Each child had the opportunity to stand up and explain his
design. While some explanations were less than original, some offered
insights into dreams, likes, and character.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">My day was complete, when all the children came up
to shake my hand and one in his broken English said to me, “madam, you
make very happy me with this shirt.”&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2.5">Its early Saturday morning and the birds are
chirping, actually never mind it’s a giant lizard. Who would’ve thought
lizards could make so much noise?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">We eat a hearty breakfast and get set for the day.
Unfortunately, there is a strike going on in the city and nearby
villages given some recent political unrest. As a result, most teachers
are on strike. However, this will not stop local children from visiting
the Agastya campus today. The Agastya bus left this morning to collect
children from nearby government schools.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">It’s about 10am, and I watch amusingly as 50 wide
eyed children hop off a colorfully painted bus and line up in an
orderly fashion to begin a day full of science and magic. The fourth
and fifth grade children have come to spend a half day at Agastya to
learn about chemistry, math, and general science.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I sit in on the chemistry class first, where
children are learning about hydrogen chloride, oxygen production and
chemical reactions. Along the perimeter of the room lie a host of fun
hands on activities specifically designed to teach the core principles
of chemistry. The children are awarded “claps” for volunteering and
participating in class discussion. The teachers captivate, stimulate
and engage children through fun role playing activities, experiments,
and the use of real life examples to demonstrates how specific
chemicals are used in daily life. The teachers also do a remarkable job
of teaching children English along the way.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I later venture into the art lab, and meet with the
Agastya art teacher. He explains his method of sensory learning whereby
children explore local materials, including rocks, leaves, and clay and
create whatever they want. The art lab is filled with mosaics made from
stones and bottle caps, tree branches combined with clay to form
animals, and a variety of paper mache projects. The goal of this class
being to allow children to create whatever they want and develop a
sense of confidence through creativity.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I then hop on the Agastya bus, and head to the
teacher training center. &nbsp;A two story building, among other things
houses a computer and math lab. I meet with the Agastya math teacher
who explains to me the various hands on math tools that have been
designed to help children learn concepts such as the Pythagorean
theorem, geometry, and general math equations. I’m incredibly
fascinated by the brightly colored geometry blocks, origami, and
activity sheets. I also have the privilege of meeting the computer
science teacher who expresses a desire to teach robotics.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I’m later taken to the Discovery Center, a new
construction built upon a slope, overlooking sprawling mountains, lush
vegetation, and a giant river. The building is no short of the
Gettysburg museum in LA, however it offers even more unique experience;
from where I’m standing now, I can see Karnataka, Andre Pradesh and
Tamil Nadu, three states making up the majority of South India. The
first two floors of the museum are lined with various science models
including a bicycle with square wheels, concave mirrors and a
whispering dome. A giant bubble machine awaits me on the bottom floor
along with a really fun drawing tool (see pictures below). &nbsp;This
place reminds me of Disneyland!</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Before the children leave for the day, they shake
my hand and say “bye madam,” and speed off to their buses. What a day?!
My jet leg is kicking in and I need a nap. I wake up 3 hours later, eat
dinner, and we all head out for a 10pm dessert excursion to a nearby
village. Ice cream, yummy!&nbsp;</font></p>

	<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Arrival at Agastya<br>Friday, January 8, 2010<br>Sanjli Gidwaney</span></p>
<p>Boston to Munich, Munich to Mumbai, Mumbai to Banglore, Bangalore to
Kuppum, and 30 hours later I arrive at Agastya, the first of four stops
on an incredible research trip to try and understand the Indian
education system. &nbsp;Right now, I cannot tell up from down, night
from day, nor breakfast from dinner. My schedule is completely out of
whack as I force myself to fight off some extreme jet leg.</p>
<p>It’s been a long drive, and we finally pull up to a dirt road
leading into a jungle of fauna and flora. I notice brightly colored
butterflies prancing from flower to flower with tremendous ease and
grace. We drive up to white cottage situated among an oasis of
tranquility. A gentleman by the name of Dr. Shibu comes running out to
greet us. I have been corresponding with Dr. Shibu for almost two
months regarding my stay. I take a few moments to settle into my room
which is clean, sparse and modern, something I was not expecting. It
feels good to wash my face and change into some fresh clothes.</p>
<p>I meet with Ms. Rao, the program manager of education for Agastya.
We enjoy a light meal together and exchange stories about our lives,
interests, and ambitions. I tell her how inspired I am by the work
Agastya is doing especially in regards to their focus on hands on and
experiential learning to teach core subjects such as math, art,
chemistry, physics and others.</p>
<p>We all retire for a few hours of rest before meeting again over a
cup of coffee. I gain valuable insights from Ms. Rao about students
from neighboring villages who often frequent the Agastya campus and
interact with the many teachers and instructors. We discuss some of the
challenges they experience including being forced to drop out of school
to earn money for their families, malnutrition, and early childhood
marriage. I’ve highlighted below some particularly interesting insights
Ms. Rao had to offer.</p>
<p><strong><br>Children</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children who frequent the Agastya campus currently attend
government schools, whereby the primary model of teaching is visual and
single sensory e.g., children learn about the five human senses by
reading from a textbook rather than actually using their many senses </li>
<li>Children have an innate desire to learn, especially when learning
is based on their own personal interests;for them learning is a matter
of survival</li>
<li>Despite there being a holiday and a regional strike in the State of
Andhra Pradesh during, children still want to attend school and
continue their education by visiting the Agastya campus</li>
<li>Students often tighten their arms and secure themselves in a self
embrace when tasked with an unfamiliar challenge– almost a self defense
mechanism</li>
<li>Children have approximately 30-40 visits to Agastya, whereby they
engage in supplementary education through experiments and various
learning tools they may not otherwise interact with</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>Teachers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Government teachers sometimes become complacent and lazy with
regards to adopting new teaching methodologies and curriculum given job
security is not tied to performance</li>
<li>Teachers often teach using incorrect pronunciations of words such as <em>jinc</em> instead of <em>zinc</em> or <em>snakes</em> instead of <em>snacks</em>.
As a result, children have a rather poor command of the English
language and as such experience a great amount of difficulty competing
for positions at top universities and job opportunities</li>
<li>Teachers need to utilize a more iterative teaching methodology,
whereby they start with sensory hands on learning, and graduate to
explanation, reading and reflection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>Parents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children are often forced to drop out of school at an early age, to
conduct house work and increase their parents financial security</li>
<li>Parents work vocational jobs in the city and have little time to spend with their children</li>
<li>Children rarely understand the financial burden parents face while putting them through school</li>
<li>Children have little spare time for homework and play, as house work takes precedence over school work</li>
<li>Parents, who strongly believe their children should attend school,
often act as catalyst for other members of their community to follow
suit</li>
<li>The opposite is also true; parents who do not support the education
of their children often spread virally negative messages about the
importance of schooling</li>
<li>Parents need to be educated to help their children’s realize their own potential</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All children are beautiful and innately possess a spark of
curiosity, courage, and creativity. A mentor, teacher, and a friend can
act as catalyst to encourage such behavior. Here, at Agastya, children
learn to take chances and learn that no answer is a bad answer. Each
child is celebrated for their unique abilities, and taught that there
is more than one right answer to a problem. Each child has a spark;
it’s a matter of sharing that same spark with the rest of the world.

	</font><p><font size="2.5"><em><strong>Scratchlets Workshop at the MIT Museum<br>Sunday, December 13, 2009<br>Sanjli Gidwaney</strong></em></font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I’m sitting on the couch, happy to complete my workshop at the MIT Museum. Today was a test of <a href="http://www.kandoproject.org/request.php?q=node/18">Scratchlets</a>, a tangible version of Scratch software; a learning tool designed by the <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/" target="_new">Lifelong Kindergarten group</a>
at MIT’s Media Lab. I created Scratchlets as a precursor to Scratch, to
teach children with limited access to computers the principles and
function of Scratch software.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">I struggled last night thinking about the best
possible way to introduce my Scratchlets tool to children from a
variety of ages and backgrounds. After much deliberation, I thought a
game might be the most appropriate route. I started by brainstorming
mini tasks children could easily perform within a 20 minute time frame.
My biggest challenge was to find ways to introduce children to concepts
of cause and effect, engage them in a debugging/problem solving, and
encourage them reflect on not only the game, but what they learned
while going through the process. So, I designed a game in which
children would be tasked to walk from one challenge station to another,
using magnetic Scratchlets pieces to program their journey and actions
along the way.</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">This morning I arrived early at the MIT Museum and
the wonderful staff helped me set up a table where I would be stationed
for the next several hours. I started chalking out a path on the ground
using painters tape to represent steps from one station to another. I
then marked the numbers 1,2,3,4 representing each station. Ironically,
there was another workshop taking place at the same time– a Lego
Mindstorms workshop. I was scared that the children would be far more
intrigued by the cool robotics than to attend my workshop.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2.5">Alas, I got my first customer, a young boy around
10 years in age, with a limited grasp of the English language. I also
had the opportunity to work with a young girl around the same age, who
was hesitant and unenthused at first, but started enjoying herself as
she jumped from one challenges station to another. I was then
approached by a very cheeky skater boy who wanted to use the
Scratchlets pieces to program various skate boarding moves. Finally, a
mother and son walked to my table curious to find out what Scratchlets
was all about. He was my last customer of the day, but boy was he going
to make me work. I made the mistake of allowing this child to use me as
his character and lead me through the circuit instead of doing it
himself. Despite me looking like a fool, I gained some very valuable
insights while turning around in circles about a dozen times.&nbsp;</font></p>
<div><font size="2.5">Some of the more interesting insights I gained were as follows:
</font><p></p></div>
<div><font size="2.5"><strong>Insights:</strong></font></div>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<font size="2.5"><li>It is very difficult not to lead children through the exercise e.g., do it for them</li>
<li>Kids read better in upper and lower case, instead of just upper case</li>
<li>Children need to be able to customize tasks e.g., do a dance to something they like such as skateboarding</li>
<li>It is important to communicate the goal of the workshop to parents and mentors for their sign off, and to garner interest</li>
<li>It is very difficult to translate workshop instructions - e.g., for a young boy who only spoke Chinese</li>
<li>Not all children are familiar with concepts of degrees, need important tricks to help them learn quickly</li>
<li>Puzzle pieces are not easy to pick up, but the concept of using physical puzzle pieces works well</li>
<li>Parents and mentors are really interested in the software and are excited to go home and download it</li>
<li>Parents and mentors like hand outs and take aways e.g., Scratch pamphlet</li>
<li>Students have more fun if they’re programming for someone else e.g., instructor/teacher</li>
<li>Children like to build upon a story, and see the result of their actions e.g., full program</li>
</font></ol>

<div><font size="2.5"><strong><br>Notable Quotes:</strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2.5"><strong>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: normal;">"This tool is neat because it
shows you that some things you can do on the computer you can do in
real life. It would be cool though to have a robot follow the
circuit/path and do what I did."</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I like the online community but can you control your privacy settings? Is it like Facebook?"</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: normal;">(After a child plays game and is shown Scratch software) “oh I remember how to do this, I have to put the move button here.”</span></li>
